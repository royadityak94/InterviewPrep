Given the weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we are asked to put these items in a knapsack which has a capacity ‘C’. The goal is to get the maximum profit from the items in the knapsack. The only difference between the 0/1 Knapsack problem and this problem is that we are allowed to use an unlimited quantity of an item.
The following problems we will be tackling in this section:
(A) Unbounded Knapsack
(B) Rod Cutting
(C) Coin Change
(D) Minimum Coin Change
(E) Maximum Ribbon Cut
