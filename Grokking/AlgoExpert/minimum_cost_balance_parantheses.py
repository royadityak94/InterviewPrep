     The task here is to correct the sequence of parenthesis in such a way that it is done in minimum cost. And shifting of parenthesis by over one parentheses costs 1. If the parenthesis canâ€™t be balanced then print -1.

     Input : ()
     Output : 0
     Explanation : Already balanced

     Input : ))((
     Output : 4
     Explanation : Firstly, ) at position 1st goes to the last position, costing 3, so we get )((). Then, ) at position 1st goes to the 2nd position costing 1. So, finally we get ()(). Therefore, the total cost is 4.
