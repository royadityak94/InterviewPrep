# Prob Nicknamed: Dutch National Flag Prob
# Given input with only three numbers (0, 1, 2) [Dutch flag has three colors, RWB], sort them in place
# You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

# Important Information:
# With in-place sorting algorithm like Heapsort, our complexity is O(NLogN), however we can do it in O(N) for this problem using the propery that:
# Maintain two pointers: left and right, bring all 0s before low and all 1s after high in single pass
